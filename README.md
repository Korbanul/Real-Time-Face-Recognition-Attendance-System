# Real-Time Face Recognition Attendance System

**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy  

## Overview
This project is a **real-time face recognition system** designed to automate attendance tracking using live video feeds. It combines **computer vision** and **deep learning** to detect and recognize faces in real time, recording attendance with timestamps for accurate monitoring.  

The system demonstrates practical AI deployment in real-world scenarios and serves as a foundation for smart automation in educational and organizational environments.

## Features
- **Real-Time Face Detection:** Detects faces in live video streams using OpenCV.  
- **Face Recognition:** Recognizes known individuals using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras.  
- **Automated Attendance Logging:** Generates timestamped attendance records in real time.  
- **Live Video Processing:** Processes video feed smoothly with real-time updates.  
- **Extensible Dataset:** Easily add new faces to the system for recognition.  

## Tech Stack
- **Python:** Core programming language for development.  
- **OpenCV:** Real-time image and video processing.  
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning for face recognition model.  
- **NumPy:** Efficient numerical computations and data handling.  

## How It Works
1. Capture video from a camera using OpenCV.  
2. Detect faces in each frame.  
3. Preprocess and pass detected faces to the trained deep learning model.  
4. Recognize faces and log attendance with date and time.  
5. Display live video with recognition results on screen.  

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained practical experience in **computer vision** and **deep learning integration**.  
- Developed skills in **real-time video processing** and **face recognition pipelines**.  
- Enhanced understanding of **AI model deployment in real-world applications**.
